## What's unicode-wtf ?

> This is a just a little toy for having fun with your work mates and friends. Look at their faces after opening its code editor !!

By defaul, unicode-wtf replaces all semicolons with unicode greek question mark, which is pretty similar to the actual semicolon, only that javascript interprets will complaint about it (o-O) !

![Example1](assets/1.gif?raw=true)

You can simply copy & paste the unicode right as an input parameter and will work

![Example2](assets/2.gif?raw=true)

You can also use globs and if not sure what unicode to use, type some of those from the available catalog

![Example4](assets/4.gif?raw=true)

This is just for fun, so please, do not forget to cure your targets back !!!!, just run the command again with the `--cure` option to restore it
